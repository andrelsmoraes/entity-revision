This library is part of a study and self-improvement project. Please, note that there are limitations, for instance, circular dependencies are not supported (yet).

The goal of this library is to create a simple way to maintain revisions of entities in a project. For now, there is a module that uses OrmLite to persist these revisions.

# Including in your project
Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.andrelsmoraes:entity-revision:1.0.0-beta2'
}
```

# Usage
```groovy
//TODO
```
