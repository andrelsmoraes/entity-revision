# entity-revision
This library is part of a study and self-improvement project. Please, note that there are limitations, for instance, circular dependencies are not supported (yet).

The goal of this library is to create a simple way to maintain revisions of entities in a project. For now, there is a module that uses OrmLite to persist these revisions.
